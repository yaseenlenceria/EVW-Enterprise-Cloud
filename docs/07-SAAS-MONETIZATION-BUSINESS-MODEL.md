## Pricing Psychology & Optimization

### 1. Anchoring Strategy

Present plans in this order:
```
ENTERPRISE    PROFESSIONAL    STARTER
  $199/mo       $75/mo        $25/mo
  (Anchor)    (Sweet Spot)   (Entry)
```

Most customers will choose **Professional** (middle option).

### 2. Annual Discount

Encourage annual commitment:
- **Monthly**: $75/month = $900/year
- **Annual**: $750/year (17% discount) = 2 months free
- **Benefits**:
  - Upfront cash flow
  - Lower churn
  - Better customer commitment

### 3. Dynamic Pricing by Region

Adjust for purchasing power parity:

| Region | GDP per Capita | Professional Plan | % of US Price |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| USA | $70,000 | $75/mo | 100% |
| UK | $46,000 | £59/mo ($75) | 100% |
| UAE | $44,000 | AED 299/mo ($81) | 108% |
| Malaysia | $12,000 | MYR 200/mo ($45) | 60% |
| Pakistan | $1,600 | Rs. 7,999/mo ($28) | 37% |

### 4. Psychological Pricing

- Use $75 instead of $80 (charm pricing)
- Show annual savings: "Save $150/year"
- Highlight most popular plan with badge
- Show price per day: "Just $2.50/day"

---

## Churn Reduction Strategy

### Target Churn Rate: < 5% monthly

#### 1. Onboarding Excellence (First 30 Days Critical)

**Days 1-7: Setup & First Invoice**
- Welcome email with video tutorial
- Live chat support available
- Goal: Create first invoice within 7 days
- Success rate: 80%+

**Days 8-14: Data Import**
- Guide to import products
- Offer free data migration service
- Goal: Import 50+ products

**Days 15-30: Team Adoption**
- Invite team members
- Role assignment
- Goal: 2+ active users

**Churn Risk**: 40% of users who don't create invoice in first 7 days will churn.

#### 2. Usage Monitoring & Intervention

**Red Flags** (trigger retention campaign):
- No login for 7 days
- No invoices created in 14 days
- Downgrade from higher tier

**Interventions**:
- Email: "We noticed you haven't logged in..."
- Offer: Free 30-min training call
- Discount: 20% off next month
- Survey: Why are you leaving?

#### 3. Feature Engagement

Track key actions:
- Invoices created
- Products added
- Customers added
- Reports viewed

**Power Users** (low churn):
- Create 10+ invoices/month
- Add 50+ products
- Use 3+ features regularly

**At-Risk Users** (high churn):
- < 5 invoices/month
- < 20 products
- Use only 1 feature

#### 4. Win-Back Campaign

For churned customers:
- Email 7 days after cancellation
- Offer: 50% off for 3 months
- Ask: What can we improve?
- Win-back rate: 10-15%
